> A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that gives any AI assistant **image understanding** over stdio. Pass an image as a public URL or base64 and the agent can read the text in a screenshot, identify what's in a scene, critique a 3D/avatar render, or write alt-text — all live, read-only, no key required.

Every answer comes from the three.ws vision pipeline: **free NVIDIA NIM vision models lead every request**, with an automatic server-side paid backstop behind them. The caller never pays and needs no provider key — point `THREE_WS_BASE` at a deployment and go.

## Install

```bash
npm install @three-ws/vision-mcp
```

Or run with `npx` (no install):

```bash
npx @three-ws/vision-mcp
```

## Quick start

**Claude Code**, one line:

```bash
claude mcp add vision -- npx -y @three-ws/vision-mcp
```

**Claude Desktop / Cursor** (`claude_desktop_config.json` or `mcp.json`):

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"vision": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "@three-ws/vision-mcp"]
		}
	}
}
```

Inspect the surface with the MCP Inspector:

```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx @three-ws/vision-mcp
```

## Tools

| Tool                | Type      | What it does                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `analyze_image`     | read-only | Answer a prompt about an image — visual Q&A, OCR (read a screenshot), classification, or critiquing a render.       |
| `describe_image`    | read-only | Natural-language description for alt text or a caption, steerable by detail level and focus.                        |
| `get_vision_status` | read-only | Report whether a vision provider is live and which image formats are accepted. No image, no cost.                  |

All three tools are read-only — they look at an image, they never store or mutate anything. A VLM is non-deterministic and the live provider chain moves, so none are idempotent.

### Input parameters

**`analyze_image`** — `prompt` (required), and exactly one of `imageUrl` (public https) or `image` (base64 / data URI). Optional `imageType` (for raw base64), `maxTokens` (16–2048, default 512).

**`describe_image`** — exactly one of `imageUrl` or `image`. Optional `imageType`, `detail` (`brief` | `standard` | `detailed`, default `standard`), `focus` (an aspect to emphasize).

**`get_vision_status`** — no parameters.

## Example

```jsonc
// analyze_image — read the text in a screenshot
> { "imageUrl": "https://three.ws/render.png", "prompt": "What does the banner text say?" }
{
  "ok": true,
  "text": "The banner reads \"three.ws — 3D AI agents\".",
  "provider": "nvidia",
  "model": "nvidia/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl",
  "prompt": "What does the banner text say?",
  "image_source": "url"
}
```

```jsonc
// describe_image — alt text from a base64 image
> { "image": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG...", "detail": "brief" }
{
  "ok": true,
  "description": "A seagull in profile against a blurred coastal background.",
  "detail": "brief",
  "provider": "nvidia",
  "model": "nvidia/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl",
  "image_source": "base64"
}
```

```jsonc
// get_vision_status — gate a "describe this" affordance
> {}
{
  "ok": true,
  "configured": true,
  "image_types": ["image/jpeg", "image/png", "image/webp", "image/gif"],
  "max_image_mb": 12
}
```

Images may be JPEG, PNG, WebP, or GIF, up to **12 MB**. Base64 inputs are size-checked locally before upload; `imageUrl` must be a public **https** URL (the vision server fetches it, so private/loopback hosts are rejected).

## Pricing & auth

There is **no charge to the caller and no key is needed**. The platform runs every request against free NVIDIA NIM vision lanes first and falls back to a paid model only on its own infrastructure — that cost is the platform's, transparent to you.

The endpoint is rate-limited per IP. To raise your limit to the per-user tier, set the optional `THREE_WS_API_KEY` (a three.ws API key); it is sent as a bearer token. It is never required to use the free model.

## Requirements

- **Node.js >= 20.**
- Network access to `https://three.ws` (or your own `THREE_WS_BASE`).

### Environment variables

| Variable              | Required | Default            | Purpose                                                       |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `THREE_WS_BASE`       | no       | `https://three.ws` | Which deployment to call.                                     |
| `THREE_WS_TIMEOUT_MS` | no       | `30000`            | Per-request timeout (a call may chain across free lanes).     |
| `THREE_WS_API_KEY`    | no       | —                  | Optional bearer token to raise the rate limit to per-user.    |
